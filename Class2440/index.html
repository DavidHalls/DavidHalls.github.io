        <h1 style="text-align: left; margin-left: 150px;">Welcome</h1>
        <p style="float:right;">
            Thank you for visiting my ePortfolio. This is a website that I have built to 
            show all of my academic goals and accomplishments, as well as tell a little 
            about me and who I am.  Above are links to my class assignments for CSIS 2440
            which I am just completing as part of the Fall 2015 semester.

        <h1 style="text-align: left; margin-left: 150px;">About Me</h1>
        <p style="float:right">
            <img src="../images2/family.jpg" alt="" style='width:350px;height:250px;float:left; margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; '/>
            My name is David and I am 37 years old. I really enjoy camping and hiking.  
            Golf is one of those four letter words that I have a love/hate relationship with.  
            Most of the time we get along though.  Snowboarding is a passion I have had
            since I was a young teenager and would love to find a way to get on the 
            mountain more.  I have two sweet little girls who let me take them
            to Lagoon, to the park and swimming.<br><br>
            For the last 15 years I was working as the Component Lab Manufacturing Supervisor.
            I was responsible for overseeing the production of around 800 units of blood
            per day.  The units of blood we were manufacturing were used in hospitals in Utah,
            Montana, Idaho and Nevada routinely and as need arose we could help 
            out hospitals across the nation.<br><br>
            With my work I started doing more and more work with computers.  Tracking
            problems, developing spreadsheets and powerpoints and some database management.
            This is what finally sparked the fire beneath me and got me to go back to 
            school and work towards becoming a Database Administrator.  Thus I enrolled 
            at Salt Lake Community College and am actively pursuing this new found dream.
