        Interview Recorded on Monday, September 12th, 2022, in Salt Lake City, Utah. Transcribed by Lark Washburn (23), grandchild of George, on December 22nd, 2022. 
        
        MAZIE:
        Okay. So you wanna start at your birth?
        
        GEORGE: 
        Yeah. Well, I don't remember my birth except where I was born. I was born and raised in Mancos, Colorado.  Mancos, Colorado is located 17 miles from Cortez, Colorado, and 30 miles from Durango. I was raised in a house in the community was called Webber. It was about two miles outside of Mancos. The house I was in, was born in, was a house that seven of my other brothers and sisters were born in. My other eight brothers and sisters were born in another house farther, a mile or so away. That was my original grandfather's homestead home. During the depression and the problems with finances and how quick the banks were to foreclose, my grandfather lost that homestead, and we moved into this house where I was born. There was at one time, 15 of us living there in that one house. It had a, an upstairs and, uh, I have no idea how everybody, or where everybody slept or if they were even all present at the same time <laugh>. But of the 16, I was number 15. I had a younger sister that was born two years later.
        
        MAZIE:
        That's Joyce, right?
        
        GEORGE:
        No, that was Anna Joanna. 
        
        MAZIE:
        Anna Joanna.
        
        GEORGE (02:27):
        Yeah. She died last year, at the age of 86, 85. 
        
        
        MAZIE:
        Was that the house that used to be like the old … 
        
        GEORGE:
        She was born in the hall.
        
        MAZIE:
        The hall, yeah.
        
        GEORGE:
        There was a, in the, in Webber, there was an LDS community, and they built this big building that was used as a meeting house, but it was also, uh, an upstairs was used for entertainment, dances and plays and et cetera that were put on there. We lost a house due to, or my parents lost the house that we were living, that I was born in, and we moved into the hall and there I spent my life up until the age of 11.
        
        MAZIE:
        Is that when you moved to the apple orchard house … after that?
        
        GEORGE:
        No.  The, uh, the hall house, the apple orchard, that was where I was born. 
        
        MAZIE:
        Ok.  And then you went to the hall house, ok.
        
        GEORGE:
        And my younger sister was born in the hall, and my memory goes back to when I was -- <begins to choke up>
        
        MAZIE (03:47):
        You're gonna make me cry!
        
        GEORGE: 
        -- two years old. And I can remember nursing on my mother with my younger sister, youngest sister had been born. So, my mother, having given birth to 16 children, was indeed prolific in producing milk <laugh>. And I can remember at the age of two nursing, along with my youngest sister.  Uh, having five brothers as I grew up, well, I was dominated by women <laugh>.
        
        
        MAZIE:
        Still are.
        
        GEORGE:
        And, uh, I played with my aunt, and my sister that was just a year and a half older and the twins, Mavis and Marge were the only set of twins born in the family. So, I basically just played with my sisters and, uh, I guess I was a rotten kid <laugh>.
        (04:46) My other sisters catered to me, took care of me. My oldest brother also catered to me, so I'm sure I was a rotten kid. Having five brothers, they thought that I should learn the same thing that they learned on the farm. So, at an early age, I learned to use a shovel, a pitchfork, an ax, a grubbing hose, anything that was applicable to farm work. I learned to put a bridle on a horse, uh, throw harnesses on 'em. And that was at the, being tutored by my brothers. They also taught me a variety of other skills. They supplied me with, uh, with all the implements that I used. They were all my size. They put small handles on the shovel and on the pitchfork and the hose to fit my size. So, I learned to use all of the farming equipment.
        
        MAZIE:
        When you were really young?
        
        GEORGE:
        Yeah, because, uh, and well that just continued on, by the time I was six and having mastered the skills of the shovel and the other implements that I used, I was strong, but I was skinny. I probably never weighed more than 70 pounds during all this period of time, if I even weighed that. But I was still strong with this light frame that I had and still have today. Uh, so I learned these skills, and that by the time I was six years old, I had a strong enough grip where I could milk a cow <laugh>. So, the age of six, I started milking a cow called Spot. And Spot was a two-year heifer. She had given birth to one calf, and she had small tits. And that's the reason I started milking her <laugh>. I had later graduated from her, I kept milking her and then I also milked another cow that was older. (06:54) So by the time I was, uh, six or seven, I was fully equipped to work on a farm. I did all the farm work, I could saddle a horse. I could put a bridle and horn on horses. I could hitch 'em up to the wagon. I could drive a team of horses. At the age of, uh, 11, I was working in the field, uh, what was called, a field we were getting ready to plant wheat in. And, uh, this was in June.
        
        MAZIE:
        So it's hot. 
        GEORGE:
        Yeah, it was in June. And I was working with two horses, a brown, a black horse, and a white horse. The white horse was named Blue, and he had to be 110 years old at least.  My brothers remembered him being old when they were kids. 
        
        MAZIE:
        Yeah. 
        
        GEORGE:
        And Nig, the other horse, was a younger mare. (07:47) And I drove them on the dragged, leveling this land, getting ready for the drill to put in the wheat. And I'd been going back and forth across the field, keeping it, leveling it down. And I lost, uh, daydreaming or something. Anyway, I drove the team too close into a swamp that was right on the border of the field. The horses went too far into the swamp. When I noticed that, I turned them too sharp, and the corner of the drag hit Nig on the hindquarters, and she bolted, and she drug poor old Blue with her. Tipped the drag over. And I saw the drag falling. I, I ran the same direction it was falling, and it, I surmised that it hit me and drug me under. The horses continued across the field. I was, I don't know where I was, but I was on the ground. (08:43) I didn't feel like I'd been knocked out. I had no bumps, no bruises, no nothing. But I was laying there on the ground. The horses went to the other side of the field like we had been doing all day, and they turned around on their own and came back and were standing right in front of me while I was laying on the ground. And I, and I was amazed that they did that, but they were standing there. I picked myself up and I noticed my hat was gone. So I looked around on the ground for my hat, found my hat, shook the dust and dirt out of it, put it on. My gloves had been drug off. So I found my gloves, put my gloves, took the dust and dirt out on my gloves, started putting them on. Then I noticed my arms, my arms were, the skin had been scraped off my arms. And the arms were not, they only had a few places that were actually bleeding. The rest of 'em were just weeping. And I looked at my arms and I thought, oh my gosh, I'm hurt. And I started to cry. And then I thought, what am I crying for? I don't hurt <laugh>. (09:47) I didn't, I didn't have any pain. Anyway, the horses were standing in front of me. So I started walking to the next field where my dad was. And he saw me, came and picked me up and took me in to see, uh, the same doctor that had delivered me, Dr. Trotter. And, uh, he had also delivered all but the twins of my brothers and sisters.
        
        MAZIE (10:12):
        So wait, how many is that? How many in total?
        
        GEORGE:
        Now that was all 16 of us. So he did, he did not deliver the, the 12th and 13th. 
        
        MAZIE:
        So 14 kids.
        
        GEORGE:
        They were the twins.
        
        MAZIE:
        <whispers> God. 
        
        GEORGE:
        But he delivered all, and he had one arm <laugh>. Anyway, he looked me over and decided that, oh, he's not, he's not bad. So he coated my arms with merthiolate or iodine or something along that nature. And, uh, it started burning. I started to blow on my arms and he scolded me for it, that I might get germs <laugh>. Anyway, he wrapped me in gauze and, uh, sent me home. And my arms swelled up. And my sister, oldest sister, who was married and had kids of her own came up. And then she scolded my dad for taking me to see that old quack <laugh>. And, uh, so she made arrangements, uh, to take me into Cortez to see the doctor. (11:12) But my arms had swelled up so much. Do you know who Alley Oop was? In the comics?
        
        MAZIE:
        Uh-uh. 
        
        GEORGE:
        He was a prehistoric comic character and his arms, forearms were, he was thin here and his forearms were muscly.
        
        MAZIE:
        Were huge, like Popeye or something? 
        
        GEORGE:
        That's what I looked like, Alley Oop <laugh>. So my sister started taking the bandages off and the blood had dried. So she heated up olive oil and soaked the bloods and pulled, and finally got the bandages off. And, uh, the ride came and took us to Cortez. And the doctor looked at me and he said he needed to be x-rayed. So from Cortez, we drove to Durango, which was now 47 miles away.
        
        MAZIE (11:55):
        Did you even have a, like, did you guys have a car?
        
        GEORGE:
        No, this was a neighbor's car.
        
        MAZIE:
        And all the roads were dirt back then.
        
        GEORGE:
        Uh, except the highway going, going from Cortez to Durango, it was paved. 
        
        MAZIE:
        Okay.
        
        GEORGE:
        So we drove, uh, to Durango and I got x-rays and I had to wait for them to be developed. Took 'em back to Cortez, and the doctor looked at the Cortez [x-rays] and he says, oh, his arm has been pulled outta joint. The right arm was pulled outta joint and your left arm has got a bone chip on it, so I can't put a cast on until we get the swelling down. So he said, go home, put wet packs on his arms 24 hours a day until the swelling goes down. So for the next, I don't know how long, next week or two weeks, all the neighbors pitched in and we kept the fire and the stove going. And I always had hot pack, hot wet packs put on both my arms. I sat up for all that period of time and all the neighbors came in and they put a hot pack, some hot packs were extremely hotter than others <laugh>. And anyway, after a certain length of time, uh, being in that position, a man came with a telegram. And now my brother <begins to choke up>
        
        MAZIE (13:18):
        Oh my gosh.
        
        GEORGE:
        Had been killed in the war. This is on D-Day, June 6th, 1944.
        
        MAZIE:
        I didn't know that.
        
        
        
        GEORGE:
        That this took place. I had four brothers in World War II, one in the Navy, one in the Army Air Corps, two in the Infantry. The one that was killed was in the 82nd Airborne Paratrooper Division. The other brother was in construction and built roads and, and uh, uh, airports throughout Italy and for the Allied forces when they were in the midst of World War II. Uh, when my brother was killed, uh, my mother had already gone to Texas. Uh, she had high blood pressure and the doctor said, if you want to live, you have to go to a lower climate. So she took my two sisters, youngest sister, and two other sisters and their child. And my dad had moved to San Antonio. Uh, so at age 11 I got the cast on my arm. And, uh, I lived, moved into town and lived with my sister who was taking care of us while my mother was gone. And, uh, the farm was still active with, uh, the twins and uh, and um, and my dad and my older brother, Pete, were still on the farm. And, uh, I lived in town until the cast came off. And when the cast came off, the doctor looked at me and he says, oh, we didn't get your arm set right. I says, uh, he says, in order to set it straight, we have to break it again. You want it to be broke again? And I said, no. And so I ended up with this. My arm is not straight.
        
        MAZIE (15:03):
        Yeah. Wait, put it out again. It doesn't go all the way straight. So was it on top of your arms or on the bottom?
        
        GEORGE:
        I don't know. The swelling?
        
        MAZIE:
        No. Like where it got scraped off.
        
        GEORGE:
        Oh, all the whole arms.
        
        MAZIE:
        All, the whole arms.
        
        GEORGE (15:18):
        Skin was all off on both. It didn't go down deep, only it took, it only took the top layer off, so it just weeped.
        
        MAZIE:
        Oh, okay.
        GEORGE:
        Most of the arms just weeped. I had a few spots where the blood actually showed up. 
        
        MAZIE:
        Yeah. 
        
        GEORGE:
        So I said, no, I did not want to go through a broken arm. And by now my mother had decided that my dad was trying to kill me.
        
        MAZIE:
        Oh my God.
        
        GEORGE:
        He wasn't. But she said she wanted to get me out of Colorado. She wanted to actually, she wanted to get me off the farm. She didn't want me to be, to be a farmer. And so at the age 11, I rode the bus from Mancos, Colorado to Albuquerque, New Mexico. And you're looking at a kid who had not been farther from town than Durango. And that was only once. You're looking at a kid who never ate in a restaurant, who never ordered food from a fast food. There was no fast food restaurants in 1940s. You're looking at a kid who was dumb.
        
        MAZIE:
        You’re not dumb.
        
        GEORGE:
        And he didn't know beans about what was happening. I got on the bus, rode the bus to Albuquerque, changed buses in Albuquerque to Oklahoma City. From Oklahoma City to Dallas, Texas. From Dallas, Texas to San Antonio. And I don't know how I managed to get there <laugh>. Uh, anyway, I got to San Antonio and somehow I knew I was supposed to get a taxi to go to where my mother was. So I got on a taxi and uh, gave them the address. And they took me to this house on, in San Antonio, 1502 North Pine Street. Isn't amazing that I remember that kind of garbage?
        
        MAZIE:
        <laugh>
        
        
        GEORGE (17:06):
        1502 North Pine Street. And it was a, it was a house. And because at this time, during World War II, San Antonio had four military bases around it. And, uh, there was no place, no apartments, no homes, no place to live. And so the city allowed residents to take their homes and make the rooms into private apartments. So the house we lived in on Pine Street, had two big bedrooms, a medium bedroom, which is the one my mother had. And my mother, in this one bedroom there was my mother and three sisters, two grandkids, and a baby, and me. And there was one bed, one ice box…
        
        MAZIE (17:55):
        All of you, were you all in the one room?
        
        GEORGE:
        Yeah. One bed. Uh, an ice box. No refrigerators, had not come out yet. And a stove with an oven in it. And, uh, you could get a 25-pound block of ice for 12 cents.
        
        MAZIE:
        <laugh>
        
        GEORGE:
        And they came and the iceman came every two or three days and filled the ice box up. Uh, we lived in that apartment and I had, uh, I don't know what I had eaten on my trip, cuz I knew, I didn't know how to order if I could even read the menus. I didn't know that. So when I got there and I told my mother I was hungry and there was a loaf of Wonder Bread sitting on the, sitting on the counter. And I opened it up and it was warm. And my mother made 10 loaves of bread a day to feed all of us. She did that five days a week. And it was warm bread and that was what I was used to, was warm bread. And I says, oh boy, warm bread. And they all laughed at me cuz the temperature in San Antonio was like a hundred degrees. 
        
        MAZIE:
        Yeah. 
        
        GEORGE:
        Everything was hot. Anyway, my mother had my sister take me up to a drugstore and uh, ordered me a hamburger. And that was my very <gets choked up>
        
        MAZIE:
        I remember this.
        GEORGE (19:23):
        My very first hamburger, I didn't even know what a hamburger was. And here it was, here comes this hamburger out and it was the best hamburger <gets choked up>. And it's still in my memory, as the best hamburger I ever had. Still is, my memory about that. Cuz I ate a few hamburgers after that for the next few years in that same drugstore where I went to work when I was 11 years old and did the cleanups. So I ate a lot of hamburgers, but that was the best hamburger I ever had. And I still have never found an equal. In all the hamburgers I've eaten.
        
        MAZIE (20:02):
        You said In and Out is like the closest one you've found.
        
        GEORGE:
        In and Out is probably the closest to that original hamburger. 
        
        MAZIE: Yeah. 
        
        GEORGE: 
        And I lo I do like In and Out, but it's not quite.
        
        MAZIE:
        It's not that one.
        
        GEORGE:
        Not quite like my first, very first hamburger. Uh, my mother, uh, got notice of my brother's death and he was my mother's favorite of all of her kids. (20:28) She, she, uh, we bought a, she bought a house that was about two blocks from Pine Street, 1503 North Palmetto, and it was a duplex. It had 10 rooms, six rooms in, uh, the side that we had. And she rented out four rooms to others.  The house payment on that was $55 a month <laugh>, if you can believe that. 
        
        MAZIE:
        Yeah. 
        
        GEORGE:
        In 1945 <laugh>. Anyway, we lived there on North Palmetto and um, uh, went to school, I started school in, uh, fifth grade, Ben Milam School, um, fifth to sixth grade. From there I went to, uh, Ralph Waldo Emerson for the seventh, eighth, and ninth grade. And from there to the San Antonio Technical and Vocational High School, graduated from there. Two weeks after I graduated from high school, I was drafted into the Korean War.  Um, took basic training from there. I was scheduled to go to Korea and my mother was bound and determined that she’d already had, my uh, uh, brother that was just five years older than me was already in the Korean conflict. And he was stationed in San Antonio and my mother was bound and determined that I wasn't gonna go anywhere. And she wrote letters to everybody, the Red Cross, the, the Army Chief of Staff, everybody.
        
        MAZIE:
        About, because she didn't want you to go.
        
        GEORGE (22:04):
        Because she'd already had five sons and she didn't think her last son ... Anyway, my orders were, when I finished basic training, my orders were to go to Korea. And, uh, we were supposed to take a train from, uh, to El Paso, Texas to, uh, Washington, Mt Olivia, and to Fort Lewis to the, uh, army base at Fort Lewis, Washington. And, uh, because the ship coming from Korea with soldiers hadn't, wasn't prepared to take anything new, and Fort Lewis wasn't prepared to take 225 recruits into Korea, so the Army gave us a 7-day leave. I went home and three days after being home, I got a telegraph from the War Department that my MOS number had been changed. I was still going overseas, but I wasn't going to Korea. Instead, Alaska was not a state yet, and so I went to Fairbanks, Alaska for my army, 17 months I spent in Alaska.
        
        MAZIE (23:15):
        I didn't know that. You were in Alaska?
        
        GEORGE:
        Yeah. Fairbanks. 
        
        MAZIE:
        I always thought you actually did go to Korea.
        
        GEORGE:
        Nope. Never went to Korea.
        
        MAZIE: 
        Huh. 
        
        
        
        GEORGE:
        And I, when I got back to from San Antonio … I had to go back to El Paso to catch a train. When I got to the train and picked up with the rest of my company that I'd gone through basic training with, got to Fort Lewis, Washington, boarded the plane. And the ship from Fort Lewis, Washington set sail, and, um, of the 225 of us, I was the only one that got off in Alaska. And I guess that's my mother's, had a hand in making sure that I didn't go to Korea. So I spent all my time in Alaska.
        
        MAZIE:
        Alaska.
        
        GEORGE (24:00):
        When I came home from Alaska, um, my mother was bound and determined that I was gonna go on an LDS mission. She was born and raised in New Zealand.  And my dad served a mission in New Zealand, and my older brother served a mission in New Zealand. My mother was personal friends with President David O. McKay. My great-grandfather William, came from England, settled in Huntsville, and, uh, was very closely associated with the McKay family. My mother, when she came from New Zealand, she lived in Salt Lake for a year before my dad came up from Colorado and got her. And she made frequent trips, uh, to Huntsville and met my great-grandmother that my great-grandfather had originally brought from England. And uh, so she was well acquainted with President McKay. So I was, it was no surprise that when I came home from the Army, I went to BYU for a year. Uh, and I, while I was at BYU I got my mission call. I didn't bother to open the letter cause I knew where I was gonna go <laugh>. I took the letter home with me when school was out and gave it to my mother. And my mother opened it up and she says, oh, you're going to New Zealand.
        
        MAZIE:
        Oh, wow.
        
        GEORGE (25:17):
        So, uh, I got, uh, went to New Zealand for two and a half years, and, um, came home from there, worked in San Antonio for a while, and then I moved to Salt Lake City in 1959 I got married in 1961.
        
        MAZIE (25:35):
        Was that to the first wife? 
        
        
        GEORGE:
        Yes. 
        
        MAZIE:
        What was her name again?
        
        GEORGE (25:39):
        Maureen, Molly Sievers.
        
        MAZIE:
        Mo, Maureen Molly Sievers. 
        
        GEORGE:
        Well, her name was Maureen, but they called her Molly.
        
        MAZIE:
        Oh, okay.
        
        GEORGE:
        And, uh, we were married for seven years and she died.
        
        MAZIE (25:51):
        How did she die, if you don't mind me asking?
        
        GEORGE:
        She was a diabetic and she got a kidney infection and, uh, they treated a kidney infection, with the medication they gave her for the kidney infection. When the liver got it, the liver treated it as a protein and the liver stopped functioning. And the doctors knew this, but they also knew that once that happened and the kidney was cured, they could put her on a high protein diet and force the liver back to work. 
        
        MAZIE:
        Okay. 
        
        GEORGE:
        The liver never came back to work.
        
        MAZIE (26:24):
        How old was she when she died?
        GEORGE:
        Um, 38.
        
        MAZIE:
        38.
        
        GEORGE:
        Her last two years of her life were miserable. Two, two weeks, every three months. She was in the hospital for the last two years of her life.  Pituitary system shut down. Fingernails, toenails dropped off, uh, hair loss.  Most miserable, miserable, terrible time. Anyway, so I, I had built my house during this time period in Salt Lake.
        
        MAZIE (26:58):
        The house we live, that you live in now, right?
        
        GEORGE:
        Yeah, I built that in, uh, 1964, moved in in 1964. 
        
        MAZIE:
        Mm-hmm <affirmative>. 
        
        GEORGE:
        And, uh, two years later I married my second wife.
        
        MAZIE (27:11):
        Mimi.
        
        GEORGE:
        She had two kids.
        
        MAZIE:
        She had my, my mom and Keisha, right?
        
        GEORGE:
        Yeah. She had the two kids. And, uh, we got married in the Salt Lake Temple and…
        
        MAZIE:
        Had five more kids.
        
        GEORGE (27:25):
        And, uh, went to Las Vegas for a vacation for weeks. And on the way to Las Vegas, my, uh, brakes went out on my car <laugh>. And we pulled into a, um, I can't remember the name of the town we pulled into. Um, anyway, they fixed the car and we went on Las Vegas. So the apartment, the room I had reserved in Las Vegas was gone by the time I got, we got there. So we went to, had to go to another motel. She wanted to see Barbara Streisand. She was performing in Las Vegas <laugh>. Barbara Streisand was not my favorite.
        
        MAZIE:
        <laugh> No.
        
        GEORGE (28:04):
        But she was my wife. So we went to see, uh, Barbara Streisand and we sat the, the, uh, maître d sat us at a table that was about 40 yards from the stage at least. And I'd been to Vegas before, so I knew that if you tipped the maître d you could get a better table. Well, I tipped him another $20 and he sat us on a, on a dias that was 10 feet from the stage. And Barbara Streisand came out and, uh, but there was no band, no nothing, she stood in front of a microphone and just sang. She did not sing one song that I knew or my wife knew. And she was drunk.
        
        MAZIE:
        Oh, yay <laugh>.
        
        GEORGE:
        She left the stage at intermission time, came back for the second half, sang songs that neither one of us had ever heard. All of her popular songs she did not sing. And she was still drunk. 
        
        MAZIE:
        Yeah. 
        
        GEORGE:
        And so my wife decided that Barbara Streisand was no longer her favorite <laugh>.
        
        
        
        
        MAZIE (29:07):
        <laugh>. What was, um, remember that one story where you had like fermented apples? That was like, that was the only alcohol you had ever tasted, was cuz they got fermented or something?
        
        GEORGE (29:18):
        Oh, when I was, uh, in school in Mancos, uh, I rode the school bus and uh, I had to go, I had to ride the school bus when I left school to go down to the farm to get the milk cows and bring the milk cows home. And this one day, uh, all the adults, the bigger boys, the 12th graders, 11th graders, stayed on the bus and they should have gotten off way before it came to my turn to get to the end of the line. And the bus driver pulled out this jug and started passing it around, and it turned out to be fermented apple cider.
        
        MAZIE:
        Yuck.
        
        GEORGE:
        Well they passed it around to me and I took a swig of that and it was by far the most nasty <laugh> thing I had ever tasted, was that…
        
        MAZIE:
        10 minutes?  <moderator lets her know there are 10 minutes left>
        
        GEORGE:
        Was that nasty apple cider. 
        
        MAZIE:
        Yeah. 
        
        GEORGE:
        Uh, I have never had a taste for alcohol. Everything I've ever tasted, beer or wine, all kind of liquors, all had the same flavor as that rotten alcohol, that rotten apple cider.
        
        MAZIE (30:21):
        And you don't like the, uh, taste of coffee either, do you? 
        
        GEORGE:
        Don't like what? 
        
        MAZIE:
        Coffee?
        
        GEORGE:
        No.  Coffee, my dad, I liked the smell. Cuz my dad drank coffee and I liked the smell. I never liked the taste.
        
        MAZIE (30:36):
        What was that one where you got outta making coffee? Was that in Alaska?
        
        GEORGE:
        Oh. When I was in Alaska, uh, the department I worked in, uh, they shared, uh, the building with the Air Force. And everybody's chipped in to buy coffee and they'd buy a big five-gallon container of coffee and they had a big 20 cup coffee machine. And then it was, everybody was supposed to take a turn making coffee. 
        
        MAZIE:
        Mm-hmm <affirmative>.
        
        GEORGE:
        I didn't drink coffee. I didn't see why I had to make coffee.
        
        MAZIE (31:05):
        You didn't like making it either.
        
        GEORGE:
        So, uh, the lieutenant was bound and determined that I was gonna learn how to make coffee. He takes me into the coffee room and, uh, instructs me the proper way. I already knew how to do it, I just … So he was showing me how to do it. And so I did it the way he, he told me and showed me and stayed with me until it started to perk. And then he left. I left, I went back later when nobody was around and I took coffee, took the lid off the coffee pot and drained coffee into the lid and poured it back over the colds <laugh>. I never had to make coffee again.
        
        MAZIE:
        Yep. I love that story.
        
        GEORGE:
         <laugh>. 
        
        MAZIE:
        Um, I also wanna know how, who taught you how to bake pies? Like where did you learn?
        
        GEORGE (31:51):
        My sister, uh, my sister Betty was a pie maker and she taught me to make the first pie dough. And uh, that was when I was about 13 years old, I made my first pie dough with her. And, uh, I made pies occasionally, but then when I married, uh, your grandma, uh, I started making pies more frequently and I got to a point where I did a lot of,
        
        MAZIE (32:16):
        I mean like the neighbors get 'em from you for their Thanksgiving.  You make, like you make so many.
        
        GEORGE:
        And bread and, uh, and take it to neighbors and I'd make pies, made all sorts of different pies. And, uh, the same crust I learned with my sister is the same crust I use today.
        
        MAZIE:
        Still the same crust. 
        
        GEORGE:
        Yeah. 
        
        MAZIE:
        Are you gonna teach anybody how to make it?
        
        GEORGE:
        I told, uh, Missy.
        
        MAZIE:
        Yeah. I wanna be there for that. 
        
        GEORGE:
        Well, you can learn. 
        
        
        MAZIE:
        You're the pie man.
        
        GEORGE (32:41):
        Missy, uh, took a video of it.
        
        MAZIE:
        Really? 
        
        GEORGE:
        Yeah. 
        
        MAZIE:
        I got a video of the Anasazi bean story, but I need to learn how to make the pie crust. 
        
        GEORGE:
        Yeah. 
        
        MAZIE:
        Um, what, I was trying to think, were you with Mimi or Molly when you owned the toy store?
        
        GEORGE (32:58):
        With Molly.  No, with Mimi.
        
        MAZIE:
        With Mimi? 
        
        GEORGE:
        Yeah. 
        
        MAZIE:
        And how long did you have that?
        
        GEORGE:
        Oh, I started out in 1973 I think, and in about 1977 we were bought out.
        
        MAZIE (33:09):
        Yeah. By, but you, why did you want a toy store? Was it just…
        GEORGE:
        Well I had gotten laid off from Hercules and, uh, because the job that I had been hired on, they had, uh, we had finished building the missiles that we were working on and so they were waiting for a new contract to come through. In the meantime, I got laid off. 
        
        MAZIE:
        Yeah. 
        
        GEORGE:
        Along with a bunch of other people. And, uh, when the, uh, contract came back on, then they rehired me and that was the time I got rid of the toy stores. And I went back to Hercules for, I spent 42 years working for Hercules.
        
        MAZIE (33:44):
        Was that the space?
        
        GEORGE:
        And I became … Pardon?
        
        MAZIE:
        Was that the space place you worked at? 
        
        GEORGE:
        Yeah.
        
        MAZIE:
        Ok.
        
        GEORGE (33:48):
        Lockheed Martin, we made rocket motors for the submarines, uh, space shuttle, the, uh, uh, orbital communication centers. We made, uh, missiles for those that shot those in there. I saw several, I saw the, um, uh, the space shuttle launched, uh, from Cape Canaveral, I was about a hundred yards from the launch site.
        
        MAZIE:
        That’s so cool.
        
        
        
        GEORGE:
        Saw all that stuff, saw the missiles, saw the space capsule that came back from the moon, was on display in, uh, in Florida.
        
        MAZIE (34:32):
        What do you think, like as you get older in life, what do you think … I'm trying to word this right, like it has, how, when you're looking back at your life, do you think it's a lot different than you thought? Like, or do you look back and you think it's, I did great …
        
        GEORGE:
        I don't, I don't ever think about that. I, it, uh, I just took life as it came. I, everything just came and I just went with what, what it came. I don't know if I made any great decisions.
        
        MAZIE (35:01):
        I think you did.
        
        GEORGE:
        About, uh, doing anything. I, and I stayed at Hercules because that was a job I knew I was a quality control inspector and I was good at that. 
        
        MAZIE:
        Yeah. 
        
        GEORGE:
        And uh, I stayed with that and Hercules kept me, they rehired me to do the very same thing I had done previously for that time. And I worked another, I retired and they called me back and I worked another six years. 
        
        MAZIE:
        Yeah. 
        
        GEORGE:
        And it was all doing the same quality control work that I had done before. So.
        
        MAZIE:
        And then, um, what was I gonna say?
        
        
        GEORGE (35:35):
        I met your, your mother survived, your, your grandma survived all that with me for the next 52 years.
        
        MAZIE:
        Yeah. How long have you guys been married now?
        
        GEORGE:
        Be going on 52 years.
        
        MAZIE:
        52. Yep. Um, what else was I gonna say? I feel like…
        
        GEORGE:
        Had 52 kids. Nine, uh,
        
        MAZIE:
        52 kids?
        
        GEORGE (36:01):
        Five kids. Two, uh, stepkids, uh, Keisha and uh, Joelle. Joelle, she died.
        
        MAZIE:
        That's my mom, yeah.
        
        GEORGE:
        And uh, so I've got now nine grandchildren and three great grandkids.
        
        MAZIE:
        No, you got four now.
        
        GEORGE:
        Four, yeah, I’ve got four.
        
        MAZIE:
        We got Mila.
        
        GEORGE:
        Four great grandkids now. Yeah.
        
        MAZIE (36:21):
        Do you think because your family was so like together, like all your siblings, that's why you've put that with our family. Like we do Sunday dinners and I think our family's really close.
        
        GEORGE:
        I like, uh, when, when my mother was alive, she insisted on having, always having the family together. Everybody that lived in San Antonio all came to my mother's house for Sunday dinner.
        
        MAZIE:
        Yeah. 
        
        GEORGE:
        Uh, she didn't accept excuses.
        
        MAZIE:
        Yeah.
        
        GEORGE (36:46):
        You came for dinner Sunday and we would have, uh, when I was living in San Antonio with them, we would have 15 to 18 family members, grandkids, would all be there for Sunday dinner.
        
        MAZIE:
        Yeah. I think you've put that into our family a lot cuz we were all super close.
        
        GEORGE (37:02):
        And that was always a fun time for my brothers and sisters. Not all my brothers and sisters lived in San Antonio. So all the family that lived in San Antonio, she came to my mother's for Sunday dinner.
        
        MAZIE:
        Yeah. I think you have made that very important to everyone in our family too. And we always get a good pie.
        
        GEORGE:
        Yeah. It's always a fun time to have the family together.
        
        
        MAZIE:
        And in North Carolina [summer 2022] we had everyone and I think that was like…
        
        GEORGE:
        Yeah, that was a fun time there.
        
        MAZIE:
        That was the best trip I think I've ever had.
        
        GEORGE:
        That's what Miles said.
        
        MAZIE:
        Yeah. I heard he said that <laugh>. The COVID part wasn't the funnest, but …
        
        GEORGE:
        Yeah, it was a fun time. 
        
        MAZIE: 
        It was. I just think you have lived a long life and your kids love you more than anything. I think you're one of the people I look up to most in life.
        
        GEORGE (37:49):
        Well, I appreciate that.
        
        MAZIE (37:50):
        You're very important to me and I think you're very important to everyone <laugh>.
        
        GEORGE (37:56):
        Well, I'm nearing the end of my days.
        
        MAZIE (37:58):
        I hate when you say that <laugh>, but I know.
        
        GEORGE:
        Two minutes left [the moderator has let him know there are two minutes left]. So, well that's, uh, a wrap up of, of, uh, my basic life. A lot of the things that I've done, uh, a lot of things that I remembered and I, my memory goes back and I remember so many things and I don't know why. The things that I remember, because I've read, I've read the Book of Mormon, I've read the Doctrine and Covenants, the DNC, the Old Testament. Many times. I've read the Book of Mormon probably at least a dozen times. The New Testament a dozen times. The Old Testament five or six times. And I cannot quote …
        
        MAZIE:
        One
        
        GEORGE:
        One scripture out of it, but I can remember things that happened like when I was two years, why do I remember stuff like that?
        
        MAZIE (38:52):
        Yeah. I mean, even when I went to Mancos, you were like, okay, you're gonna go to the red light, take a right. Yeah. When you go past the apple tree, take a left <laugh>.
        
        GEORGE:
        You see, I don't know why my memory is like it is. I wish I could remember the scriptures.
        
        MAZIE:
        Yeah, I understand that.
        
        GEORGE:
        I envy people who stand up and start quoting scriptures and I'm, they quote something and I remember it, but I couldn't quote it.
        
        MAZIE (39:15):
        Yeah. But your stories are more interesting, I think. 
        
        GEORGE:
        Yeah. 
        
        MAZIE:
        Well I love you and I'm really glad we did this. 
        
        GEORGE:
        Yes. 
        
        MAZIE:
        And you're the best man I know. Love you, Papa.
        
        GEORGE (39:29):
        Okay. Love you too. Sweet babe.
        
        MODERATOR: (39:32):
        I'm gonna do 10 seconds of silence and then stop it.
        
        GEORGE (39:34):
        Okay. So this is the end.
        
        MODERATOR (39:39):
        If you want to say something else, anything you want to say before we stop?
        
        GEORGE (39:43):
        Uh, no, I'm, um, I've left out a lot of things that happened, uh, in all that period of time that, uh, I remember. Uh, but things, uh, something has, sometimes things have to trigger my mind in order for those things to pop up. 
        
        MAZIE:
        Yeah.
        
        GEORGE:
        Um, but they're still there. 
        
        MODERATOR:
        Yeah. 
        
        GEORGE:
